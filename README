# Ember Ace Plugin

For older versions of Ember-cli - in this case 0.2.3 - the really greate new
awesome ember-ace addons are useless.. they simply depend on a higher version
of ember and ember-cli. To cope with the problem, I've created this simple
ember addon to wrap Ace.

Multiple attempts were made with ember-browsify to make Ace work.
